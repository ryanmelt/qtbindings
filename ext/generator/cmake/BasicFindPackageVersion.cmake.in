# This is a very basic file for the new style find_package() search mode,
# i.e. Config-mode. It is used by MACRO_WRITE_BASIC_CMAKE_VERSION_FILE() from 
# MacroWriteBasicCMakeVersionFile.cmake.
# In this mode find_package() searches for a <package>Config.cmake 
# file and an associated <package>Version.cmake file, which it loads to check 
# the version number.
# This file can be used with configure_file() to generate such a file for a project
# with very basic logic.
# It sets PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT if the current version string and the requested
# version string are exactly the same and it sets PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE
# if the current version is >= requested version.
# If this is not good enough for your project, you need to write your own
# improved <package>Version.cmake file.
# This file requires the following three variables to be set:
#   PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR
#   PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR
#   PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH
